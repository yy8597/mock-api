# Mock API Example

This is an example Mock API for rapid front-end development. I walk through how to build this from scratch in [Building a JavaScript Development Environment](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house) on Pluralsight.

## Quick Start

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start`
3. Load http://localhost:8888/web/success

## Next Steps

Generate PUT, POST requests against the mock API and note that changes are saved to db.json, so they're reflected on refresh like a real database exists! To see this in action, check out [Building a JavaScript Development Environment](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house) on Pluralsight.
